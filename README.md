### Tuts+ Course: Authentication With Laravel 5
**Instructor: Andrew Perkins**

In this course, we'll introduce you to authentication while using many of the new features found in Laravel 5. We'll start with installation and setup, and then we'll cover many of the cool new features of the Laravel authentication system such as the new AuthController, annotation routing, middleware, and FormRequests. Lastly, we'll put everything that we've learned into action to build a simple authentication system with full user registration, login and logout functionality.
